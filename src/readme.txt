CONFUSED??

Don't know which of Injector.php or Injector_5.php
to choose from?

Injector.php has complete support for PHP 7, it's
possible you've not heard of PHP 7 yet or you haven't
upgraded (which BTW, you must have a very good reason for)
So the script has been rewritten (Injector_5.php)
with support for the already 'legacy' versions of php.

I recommend leaving the import.php script as is, if you
are in a development environment, but please try as much as
possible to change exit() to some proper logic you use
for error reporting in your production environment.

Enjoy!
